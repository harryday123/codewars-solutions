# Codewars Solutions

Hey guys, this repo is a collection of all the codewars kata I have completed. I mainly only do Python and JS so don't expect other languages solutions.

Mainy of my answers also include help from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (of course xD) so don't hate for that and I have included any links to posts or my won questions on there.

## What is Codewars?
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a website where the community can submit challenges or (kata) for others to complete. Each kata has a specification with what is given in the function and what is expected out. Multiple tests are used which also includes random tests to ensure your program works.

Once you have submitted your final solution to the site, all the other user-submitted solutions are displayed ranked from best to worse on two scales, `Best Practices` and `Clever solutions`. This page allows you to vote for other solutions and allows you to see the most efficient solution for that kata.

## Format
For all the kata I complete and upload here the first line will be the link to the kata. Then my solutions and attempts will be next, followed by my final solution and then finally the top voted solution for that kata.

Any time I use solutions or help from StackOverflow, the link or links will be provided as well at the relevant point in the file.
